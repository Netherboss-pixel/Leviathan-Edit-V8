> **"The editor that looks like it was stolen from a three-letter agency."**

A hyper-stylized, classified-themed, offensive-security code editor built purely in Python/Tkinter. Designed for red teamers, pentesters, CTF players, and anyone who wants their text editor to feel like they just breached a SCIF.

### Features That Will Make You Question Your Current IDE

- 10 insane cyberpunk / government-black-ops themes (FBI Terminal, CIA BlackOps, NSA Quantum, Matrix Rain, Blood Agent…)
- Real-time Pygments syntax highlighting for 13 languages (Python, Bash, JS, C/C++, Go, Rust, PHP, SQL, etc.)
- Jedi-powered intelligent autocomplete (yes, real Python autocomplete in a Tkinter editor)
- Built-in classified payload template database (reverse shells, XSS, SQLi, LFI, command injection, Metasploit handlers, etc.)
- Custom template folder support — drop your own .py/.sh/.txt payloads and they instantly appear
- Base64 & URL encoder/decoder tools
- Live hash type identifier
- Custom background images with darkening filter (because you need that cyber aesthetic)
- Full window transparency control (ghost mode activated)
- Custom color picker for every element
- Line numbers with zero-day style formatting (00001, 00002…)
- Right-click → "Insert Template" menu with all payloads
- Font zoom, window scaling, and more
